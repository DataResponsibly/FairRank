As part of the FairRank package, we include two real datasets, German
Credit
(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+(German+Credit+Data))
and ProPublica's COMPAS dataset
(https://github.com/propublica/compas-analysis).

Our version of the datasets includes a subset of manually choosen
attributes.  Further, we binarized the sensitive attributes on
different thresholds.

The processed datasets were used in experiments as reported in
https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08559.
