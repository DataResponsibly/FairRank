We includes two real data sets here: German credit data and ProPublic data.
German credit data is originally available in UCI. Link is https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+(German+Credit+Data).
ProPublic data is originally described in https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm. Data can be found in here https://github.com/propublica/compas-analysis.

Our version of data only includes some manually choosed attributes from original one. We binarized the sentitive attributes on different threshold for these two data sets. And upload the processed data here. These processed data is used in experiments of poster_FATML16 and arXiv_FATML16 (both can be found in docs).
